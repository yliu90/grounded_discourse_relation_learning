  ==> malmo project


  ==> experience generation
      --> a script to platform code to generate particular scene 
          collect experience from malmo
      --> /data/scene data experience
          --> scene 1. script 2. expereince_s multiple experiences
      --> /code/event detector 
          --> event detector focus on interesting event such api is easily to extend to pure sensor input, which is not our point 
      --> physical feature (temporal feature for event)

  ==> build contextual data/ pure code 
      --> generate the sentence pair (micro discourse)
      --> label with human annontation and script assistance

  ==> model training  
 
  ==> build grounded experience feature/ experiments 
  ==> relation learning

after test the temporal clues we found that since the actual event provide clues does not match the experience, therefore, we decrease the instance number to adjust the example strategy 
  ==> many examples are wrong ... fix with similiarity and experience
